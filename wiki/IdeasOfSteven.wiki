Steven's very rough cube [StevenCubeModel representation model]


= Modes =
 * Time Attack (competing based on real-time elapsed)
 * Move Battle (competing based on number of moves)
 * Point Match (competing based on points, explained later)


= Global Game Parameters =
_Global Game parameters can apply to any mode._
  * Single-Player vs. Multi-Player
  * AI Player(s)
  * Challenge Mode
  * Backdrop
  * Picture Cubelets
  * Color Duplication

= Single-Player Modes = 
  * Scenario (complete a starting configuration within a specified metric)

= Pointmatch =
_Time and move count both decrease rewards_
  * Create X shape on one side 
  * Create X shape amongst the sides
  * Perform X specific rotations

= Challenge Mode =
_Events to mix up a Rubik's Cube game, changing the game experience without changing the core game._
  * Colors switch with each other (red becomes green, green becomes blue, etc)
  * Colors all become hues of one base color (red becomes dark green, blue becomes very dark green, yellow becomes light green, etc)
  * Point Of View shifts randomly (perhaps with a neat "dropped the cube" animation)
  * A cubelet becomes locked for 3 moves
  * Certain rotations are made by the computer (slow enough to follow and undo easily)
